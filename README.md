## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Airlines System project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitesh006/Airlines_System.git
   cd Airlines_System
   ```

2. Compile the project using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o airlines_system main.cpp
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./airlines_system
   ```

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **GCC Compiler**: Version 9 or higher
  - Verify GCC installation:
    ```bash
    gcc --version
    ```

- **DLL Files** (For Windows users):
  - Ensure that essential dynamic link libraries (DLLs) required by GCC are available on your system. These are typically included with MinGW or Cygwin installations.

- **C++17**: The project requires a compiler that supports C++17 features.

## Features and Concepts Used

This project leverages several key programming concepts:

1. **File Handling**:
   - Read and write operations to store and retrieve data persistently.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to model real-world entities and establish relationships between classes.

3. **Standard Template Library (STL)**:
   - Efficient use of `std::vector` to manage dynamic arrays and streamline data manipulation.

---

## Usage

After running the application, you will have access to the following functionalities:

- Manage airline bookings.
- View and update flight schedules.
- Handle customer and ticketing data efficiently.
